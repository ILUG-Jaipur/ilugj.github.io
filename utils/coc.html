      <h1>Code of conduct</h1><br>
      
      <div align="left">
        
        <p><b>General guideline: </b>
        Developers participating in the projects are expected to enable a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
        </p>

        <h2>Standards</h2>
        <p>These are some of the standards everyone is expected to follow:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Using welcoming and inclusive language</p></li>
            <li><p>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</p></li>
            <li><p>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</p></li>
            <li><p>Focusing on what is best for the community</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Resolving conflicts</h2>
        <p>Conflict is not bad, healthy debate 
            and disagreement often yields positive results. However, it is unacceptable
            to be disrespectful or to engage in behavior that violates the projectâ€™s 
            code of conduct.

            Complaints regarding violation of the code of conduct will be looked at seriously. If a person is found guilty of violating the programme's conduct, be it, mentor or developer, he/she will be banned from the programme with immediate effect.
